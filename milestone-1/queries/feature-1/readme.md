## Feature 1
This feature lets the user explore the form of all drivers given a time frame within a season.
### Interface Description
The interface will consist of three boxes that the user can submit a `season`, representing the season they would like to query, a `starting round`, and an `ending round`. In F1, races are ordered by rounds, so starting and ending round essentially mean between which two races in the season (inclusive) does the user want to examine.
### Users
The users of the interface will be people interested in exploring the form of all drivers given a time frame within a season. For example, they can be trivia nerds, journalists, or people that want to place a bet and need to see recent form.

The user will interact with the interface by entering their desired parameters into the boxes, then clicking the button, and the screen will refresh with the desired data.
