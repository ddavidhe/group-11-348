## Feature d
This feature allows the user to get the time difference between a selected driver's first lap and pit laps, for a selected race.
### Interface Description
The interface will consist of 2 boxes that the user can submit a race (dID), representing the race they want to query, and a driver (dID), representing the driver of interest. The delta is calculated using the equation: `first_lap_time - pit_lap_time`, so a positive delta implies that the pit lap is faster.
### Users
The users of the interface will include motorsport enthusiasts, analysts, and bettors who want to examine a driver's performance within a given timeframe during a season. Users could be trivia enthusiasts, journalists researching a story, or sports bettors analyzing recent driver form.

The user will interact with the interface by entering their desired parameters into the boxes, then clicking the button, and the screen will refresh with the desired data.
